INTRODUCTION
       
       This project is about implementation of a wireless real-time home automation system based on Arduino and GSM module.This project is about building a home automation system,where the user can control the home appliances by simple phone including a GSM module,just by sending SMS through the phone.In this project just a old phone using GSM is enough to switch ON and OFF any home appliances from anywhere.
